E.g. binary attributes\nwork as expected. Adding the `hidden` attribute makes them disappear.\nIntinsic properties of components will default to `null` rather than `undefined`.\n\nSimilarly, because web-components are highly interoperable, there's no reason to reinvent\nwheels. In particular, this library won't try to replace existing, excellent libraries\nsuch as [shoelace.style](https://shoelace.style/) or wrap perfectly functional HTML\nelements, like the venerable `<input>` or `<form>` elements that are already capable\nand accessible.\n\nThe goal here is to provide useful components and other utilities that add to what's built into HTML5 and CSS3.\n\n## custom elements\n\nThe simplest way to use these elements is to simply import the element and then either\nuse HTML or the `ElementCreator` function exported.\n\nE.g. to use the markdown viewer:\n\n```\nimport { markdownViewer } from 'xinjs-ui'\n\ndocument.append(markdownViewer(`\n# hello world\nhere is some markdown\n`))\n```\n\nAssuming you import the javascript somewhere, this HTML will work as well.\n\n```\n<markdown-viewer>\n# hello world\nhere is some markdown\n</markdown-viewer>\n```\n\nThe big difference with using the `markdownViewer()` function is that the `xinjs` `Component`\nclass will automatically pick a new tag if the expected tag is taken (e.g. by a previously\ndefined custom-element from another library). `markdownViewer()` will create an element of\nthe correct type.\n\nThe other thing is that `xinjs` `ElementCreator` functions are convenient and composable,\nallowing you to build DOM elements with less code than pretty much any other option, including\nJSX, TSX, or HTML.\n",

Criteria are space-delimited, but\na quoted string which can include spaces (but not nested quotation marks) is allowed on the right.\n\n`<filter-builder>` has sets its `filter` property to an `ArrayFilter`, by default it just passes through\nthe array untouched. Its `value` is the source `string`.\n\nThe filter-builder has a default set of `FilterMaker` objects which it uses to **curry** an filter function.\n\n    type ObjectTest (obj: any) => boolean\n\n    interface FilterMaker {\n      hint: string                                    // describes the grammar\n      description: (...matches: string[]) => string   // describes the actual filter\n      token: RegExp                                   // matches the token\n      filterMaker(...matches: string) => ObjectTest   // builds an ObjectTest\n    }\n\nThe `<filter-builder>` will use the `hint` values to write its `placeholder` (you can override this if\nyou explicitly set the `placeholder`) and it will use the `description` function to create the\n`title` attribute, describing the filter.\n\n## availableFilters\n\nAs well as `filterBuilder`, the `availableFilters` collection is exported and can be customized directly. By default,\neach `<filter-builder>` element's `filters` property defaults to `availableFilters` but you can augment it or\nindividually set.\n\nThe default `filters` provided are (in priority order):\n\n- `[field]=value` if `field` is specified, matches `value`, otherwise looks for `value` anwhere\n- `field!=value` matches if `field` is not `value`\n- `field<<value` / `field>>value` matches if `field` is before / after `value` (as a date)\n- `field>value` / `field<value` matches if `field` is greater / less than `value`, if `isNaN(Number(value))` this will\n  be an alphabetical order comparison, otherwise it will be numberic.\n- `field:value` / `field!:value` matches if `field` contains / does not contain `value`\n- `!!field` matches if `field` is **truthy**\n- `!field` matches if `field` is **falsy** (e.g. `''`, `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`)\n- `value` matches if any field contains `value`\n\nRight now multiple criteria are `AND`ed together. This will be extended to allow `()`, `OR`, `<` and `>` comparisons will\nbecome smarter (convert both sides to numbers if possible), and extensibility will be added.\n\n### Customizing Filters\n\nFilters should be ordered from strictest `token` to least-strict `token` where tokens have a chance of\noverlapping. E.g. the `>>` (before) token has to be before the `>` (greater than) token, otherwise `>` will steal its tokens\n(and the arguments of tokens are very liberal, since you never know what string someone will want to compare something to).\n\nI just needed the new capabilities for the project I'm working on and figured they were probably pretty likely to be useful to other people.\n\nA filter is just an object that conforms to the `FilterMaker` interface. E.g. the \"contains\" filter looks like this:\n\n```\n{\n hint: 'field:value',\n explanation: 'field contains value, ignoring case',\n description: (field: string, value: string) =>\n   `${field} contains \"${value}\"`,\n token: /^([^\\s]+?):(.+)$/,\n makeFilter: (field: string, value: string) => {\n   value = value.toLocaleLowerCase()\n   return (obj: any) =>\n     String(obj[field]).toLocaleLowerCase().includes(value)\n },\n}\n```\n\nThis is sufficient to make each filter atom composable and self-documenting as a text `hint`, in general `explanation`, and in particular `description`.\n\nTokens are matched against a term, and must return enough values to drive `makeFilter`. A **term** currently looks like:\n\n`query.match(/[^\\s\"]+(\"[^\"]+\")?/g)`\n\nI.e. a bunch of non-whitespace characters optionally followed directly by a double-quoted string (containing not double-quotes). E.g. `foo` `$$foo:bar!><` or `foo\"bar baz\"`.",

    "text": "# makeSorter\n\nI'm always confusing myself when writing sort functions, so I wrote `makeSorter()`. It's\ninsanely simple and just works™. It makes writing an array sort callback for anything\nother than an array of numbers or strings easier.\n\nUsage:\n\n```\ninterface Person {\n  nameFirst: string\n  nameLast: string\n}\n\nconst people: Person[] = await getRecords(...)\n\n// sort by nameLast, then nameFirst\nconst nameSorter = makeSorter(\n  (person: Person) => [person.nameLast, person.nameFirst]\n)\n\npeople.sort(nameSorter)\n```\n\nHere's a slightly more complex example:\n\n```\ninterface Product {\n  name: string,\n  category: string,\n  sales: number\n}\n\nconst productSales = await getRecords(...)\n\n// sort by category (A-Z), then sales (highest to lowest)\nconst categorySalesSorter = makeSorter(\n  (product: Product) => [product.category, -product.sales]\n)\n\nproductSales.sort(categorySalesSorter)\n```\n\nBasically, you write a function that given some thing returns a prioritized list of\n`string`s or `number`s and `makeSorter` produces an callback function for `Array.sort()`\nthat will sort the array in _ascending_ order.\n\nIf you pass `false` as the (optional) second parameter you'll get a _descending_ sorter,\nbut for numbers just multiplying by -1 is just as easy (per the example).\n\nIf I ever conceive of a need for a version that lets you invert the sort order of\nmultiple non-numerical array elements I'll extend it.",
