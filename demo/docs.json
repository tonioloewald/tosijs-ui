In particular, this library won't try to replace existing, excellent libraries\nsuch as [shoelace.style](https://shoelace.style/).\n\nThe goal here is to provide useful components that augment what's built into HTML5.\n\n### `<tab-selector>`\n\nA tab-selector with nice animations.\n\n### `<map-box>`\n\nA mapboxgl wrapper.\n\n### `<bodymovin-player>`\n\nA bodymovin, a.k.a. lottie, player.\n\n### `<data-table>`\n\nA virtual data-table, configurable via a `columns` array (which will automatically be generated if not provided),\nthat displays gigantic tables with fixed headers (and live column-resizing) using a minimum of resources and cpu.\n\n### `<markdown-viewer>`\n\nRender markdown anywhere, either using the `src` attribute to load the file asynchronousely, or\njust put the text inside it:\n\n    <markdown-viewer src=\"/path/to/file.md\">\n\nOr (but don't include the indentation!!):\n\n    <markdown-viewer>\n      # hello\n      world\n    </markdown-viewer>\n\n### `<filter-builder>`\n\nAutomatically creates `ArrayFilter` functions `(a: any[]) => any[]` based on a text query that accepts the\nfollowing space-delimited criteria — all text matches are performed in `LocaleLowerCase`\n\n- `string` will match any record that has a property that contains `word`\n- `field:string` will match any record that has a property `field` containing `string`\n- `field:>string` / `field:<string` will match any record that has a property `field` > / < `string` (alphabetic for now)\n- `!field` will match any record where `field` is **falsy**\n- `field!` will match any record where `field` is **truthy**\n\nRight now multiple criteria are `AND`ed together. This will be extended to allow `()`, `OR`, `<` and `>` comparisons will\nbecome smarter (convert both sides to numbers if possible), and extensibility will be added.\n\n## utilities\n\n### scriptTag & styleSheet\n\nIf you need to load an old schoole javascript library via cdn (both mapboxgl and bodymovin are\nfine examples) then use these two functions. They return promises that resolve when the\nmodule in question has loaded.\n\nUsage:\n\n    import { scriptTag } from 'xinjs-ui'\n\n    const bodymovinAvailable = scriptTag('../lottie.min.js')\n\n    bodymovinAvailable.then(() => {\n      globalThis.bodymovien.loadAnimation(...)\n    })\n\n`<bodymovin-player>` is implemented in such a way that if you've preloaded the module\n(e.g. via a script tag or packaging) it won't load it again, which affords offline\nuse.\n\nThere's no point for mapbox since it won't work without connectivity anyway.\n",
