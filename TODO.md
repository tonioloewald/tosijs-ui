## Doc-System Roadmap

See [doc-system-roadmap.md](doc-system-roadmap.md) for the full plan. North star:
each library is a web-accessible doc-system endpoint (library-as-ESM + docs +
authoring), with **tjs-lang** as the live-example transpiler, the **tosijs-ui doc
system** as build/docs/front-end, and an **AJS-VM universal endpoint** as the
back end. Sequence: `./docs` subpath refactor → #6 tjs+CodeMirror → #5 haltija
widget → #4 edit source → #3 save/load examples → #1 ePub → #2 PDF. Phase-2:
importmap example resolution, versioned endpoints, AJS RestStore.

## High Priority

- **JSON Schema-driven form editor** - Integrate schema-based form generation

## Book / prose adoption (from `falling-forward`, 1.6.15)

The doc-system assumes a **code library with a `src/` tree**; a book has no code,
uses different Markdown, and needs a *curated book artifact*, not just a site.
Full write-up in the adopter's `TOSIJS-UI-FEEDBACK.md`.

**Done (quick wins):**
- ✅ #4 Auto-serve `/iife.js` when `bundleEntry` is omitted (copy tosijs-ui's own
  iife into the output, version-matched) — pure-docs sites hydrate out of the box.
- ✅ #7 Skip `_`-prefixed scaffolding files (`_template.md`, `_drafting-log.md`).
- ✅ #12 Empty metadata `title` falls back to the H1 (was blanking nav entries).
- ✅ #6 Warn when no ePub cover is generated (@resvg/resvg-js missing); title-only
  cover already works when it's present.

**Queued — P1 (high impact for prose):**
- #1 **Markdown footnotes** (`[^id]`) — endnotes/popups in ePub, page-anchored
  footnotes w/ cross-refs in PDF. Flagship prose gap; differentiator.
- #2 **YAML frontmatter** — parse & strip a leading `---…---` block, map
  `title`/`order`/`date`/`author`/`draft` onto doc metadata (or at least warn
  instead of rendering "---" as the title).
- #3 **First-class "book" corpus** — a manifest (`book: { include, order,
  frontMatter, backMatter }`) so a project can serve a full site AND emit a
  curated, ordered book with title/copyright/dedication/about pages.

**Queued — P2:**
- #5 Wikilink `[[slug]]` / `[[slug|label]]` resolution (basename match, toggleable).
- #8 Order by filename/path within a section (natural sort), `order` as override.
- #9 A `kind: 'book' | 'library'` preset with sane content-project defaults
  (no `src/`/`demo/` assumptions).
- #10 Folder structure implies nav sections (`chapters/book-1/*` → "Book 1").

**Queued — P3:**
- #11 Friendlier metadata entry (the planned metadata UI, or #2's YAML).
- #13 Optional built-in epubcheck (or a documented validation pass).
- #14 Smart typography (curly quotes, en/em dashes, ellipsis) opt-in; word-count
  / reading-time per doc + total.

## Example captures (live-example → static images)

Design landed; not built. See **"Example captures"** in
[doc-system-roadmap.md](doc-system-roadmap.md). Capture is *exhaust from normal
dev*: embedded **private haltija** (per-app socket, beta 10) holds a single
`getDisplayMedia` stream and `grabFrame()`s on demand (crop to the example rect),
so testing/posing an example self-captures; haltija puppeting fills gaps. Manual
captures are sticky; organic ones refresh only when the example's **code hash**
changes. One asset, three consumers: **ePub images**, **no-JS / pre-hydration
placeholder**, optional ePub cover hero. Builds on `ExampleKey` + the dev-write
endpoint (Foundations B/C). Depends on **#5 (haltija-in-dev widget)** landing the
private-mode socket first.

**Book ↔ live-site fidelity ladder** (phase-2, greenlit) — one example source, three
tiers: (1) static captured image + code (every reader); (2) each book example
**deep-links to its anchored spot on the live site** (ePub/PDF link + **QR for
print**), version-pinned `/v{version}/{slug}/#{id}`, stable `id=` fences not
ordinals; (3) **inline interactive** in Apple Books / Readium via scripted EPUB3
(`properties="scripted"`, pre-transpiled + inlined, image fallback — NOT the dead
iBooks Author format). Needs per-example **anchors + scroll-to/highlight on the
live site** (independently useful). See roadmap "From book to live."

## Medium Priority

- **Vector similarity search for doc-browser** - Replace current search with vector-based approach
- **Focus management and focus-visible styling** - Improve keyboard navigation and focus indicators

## Localization

- Adding automatic localization where appropriate:
  - `<tosi-password-strength>`
  - `<tosi-tag-list>`
  - `<tosi-filter>`

## Components

### `<tosi-b3d>`
- Converting this to a blueprint

### `<tosi-filter>`
- Leverage `<tosi-select>` for picking fields etc.
- Leverage `<tosi-tag-list>` for displaying filters compactly
- Leverage `popFloat` for disclosing filter-editor

### `<tosi-editable>`
- Add support for disabling / enabling options
- Hide lock icons while resizing
- Maybe show lines under locks indicating the parent
- Support snapping to sibling boundaries and centers

## Build System

- **Built-in custom icon generation for `tosijs-ui/site`** — currently a consumer
  generates an icon module with the shipped `tosijs-make-icons` CLI and registers
  it via `defineIcons` in their bundle entry. Make it first-class: export
  `generateIconData({ input, output })` from `tosijs-ui/site` (refactor
  make-icon-data's core into an importable function, CLI as a thin wrapper) so it
  can run from a doc-site `prebuild` hook with no shelling out. Possibly a config
  field (`icons: { input, output }`) that the orchestrator runs automatically.
- ~~Better leveraging of tree-shaking~~ (unbundled ESM output, sucrase as peer dep)
- **Migrate CDN-loaded libraries to peer deps** — now that ESM output is unbundled, these can be normal imports (tree-shaken when unused):
  - `<tosi-code>` — replace ace editor with CodeMirror (peer dep)
  - `<tosi-b3d>` — `@babylonjs/core` as optional peer dep (currently loads via `scriptTag` from CDN)
  - `<tosi-lottie>` — `lottie-web` as optional peer dep (currently loads via `scriptTag` from CDN)
  - `<tosi-map>` — `mapbox-gl` as optional peer dep (currently loads via `scriptTag`/`styleSheet` from CDN)

## Completed

- ~~Add unit tests for components~~
- ~~Add accessibility (ARIA) attributes to components~~
- ~~xin → tosi rename (all exports, classes, tags, interfaces)~~
- ~~Drop menu support (`popDropMenu`, `hideDisabled`, dynamic `menuItems`)~~
- ~~Drag-and-drop MutationObserver for dynamic drop targets~~
- ~~Agent-based QA using Haltija~~ (`bun run test-browser`)
